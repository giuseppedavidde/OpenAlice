# Workspace collaboration — `alice`

OpenAlice owns addresses, delivery, durable work, and provenance. Coding Agents
keep using their native file, search, and Git tools inside any resolved path.

## The command model

| Group | Owns | Does not own |
|---|---|---|
| `peer` | Active Workspace discovery, absolute paths, Session directory | File reading or research |
| `conversation` | Ordinary Agent-to-Agent requests and replies | Human notification |
| `inbox` | Outward-facing human notifications, reports and follow-up | General peer chat or file storage |
| `issue` | Durable work, ownership, scheduling, Activity | Ad-hoc questions |
| `provenance` | Artifact-to-Session attribution | Guessing intent |
| `signature` | The current Session's safe `@resumeId` | Runtime-native ids |
| `session` | This Workspace's coworker nametag | Conversation title, AI binding, or launcher nickname |
| `track` | Shared durable asset/topic index | Work status |
| `template` | Managed Workspace guidance upgrades | Harness research lifecycle |

Start with live intent help whenever the route is unclear:

```bash
alice
alice <group>
alice <group> <verb> --help
```

## Talk to another Agent

Use `conversation`, not Inbox, for ordinary coworker communication.

```bash
# Discover the active office floor and choose a desk.
alice peer list

# Recruit a fresh Session at that Workspace for new work.
alice conversation create --ws-id <workspaceId> \
  --prompt 'Investigate this bounded question and report back.'

# Continue one exact attributable product Session.
alice conversation ask --resume-id <resumeId> \
  --prompt 'Explain the missing context.' --await

# Ask the attributable sender of one Inbox delivery.
alice conversation ask --inbox-id <entryId> \
  --prompt 'What did you send, and what should I inspect first?' --await

# Recruit a fresh Session in a Harness default Workspace.
alice conversation create --harness autoquant \
  --prompt 'Start a new quantitative research assignment.'
```

`--harness chat` follows the recent/default Chat desk policy and creates the
stable starter Chat Workspace only when none exists. `--harness autoquant`
requires the explicitly initialized AutoQuant default Workspace and never
creates or guesses one. Both launch a fresh product Session in the resolved
desk; use the returned `resumeId` for later continuation.

`create` always creates a new Session and sends its first prompt. `ask --resume-id`
continues an existing Session. Keep `resumeId` as the coworker's address and
`taskId` as one turn's execution handle.

Both commands accept optional `--credential <vault-slug>` or
`--credential-source native` (mutually exclusive), `--model <id>`, and
`--effort <level>`. Never pass API keys. New Sessions inherit Workspace headless
preferences; existing Sessions retain their own binding for omitted fields.
Changing credential drops inherited model/effort from the previous credential.
Explicit changes to an existing Session persist for later turns and require it
to be idle. Its Agent runtime cannot change. `--agent` selects only a new worker.

Prompts are ordinary coworker messages. Add `--reconstruct` only when the task
explicitly requires a fresh worker to reconstruct missing historical intent.
Provenance may still report `resolution.mode: reconstructed` without changing
the prompt when no original author is available.

Choose the waiting rhythm from the work:

- A short answer needed now: add `--await`.
- A longer delegation: omit `--await`, retain `taskId`, then retrieve it later.
- Several independent peers: dispatch first, then collect the task ids together.

```bash
alice conversation await --task-id <taskId>
alice conversation read --task-id <taskId>
alice conversation collect --task-id <taskA> --task-id <taskB>
```

Conversation work has no implicit execution deadline. `--await`, `conversation
await`, and `conversation collect` also wait for terminal task state when no
limit is supplied. Add `--timeout-ms <milliseconds>` only when the caller
deliberately wants a hard execution watchdog (for `conversation ask`) or a
bounded server-side wait (for `await`/`collect`). A bounded wait returning does
not stop a task unless that same explicit timeout was attached at dispatch.

There is no unsolicited Agent-to-Agent completion notification bus. Inbox
notifies the human; `await`, `read`, and `collect` retrieve direct Agent replies.
Do not build shell sleep loops.

## Notify the human and deliver reports

Inbox is OpenAlice's outward-facing notification and reporting surface for the
human. Use it for alerts, findings, reports or requests for attention that need
a separate delivery record. It is not the Workspace's file store or a general
Agent-to-Agent message channel.

A normal conversation reply already reaches the user. For attachments in a
Connector reply, use `[[reports/summary.pdf]]` as described in `file-delivery`;
no Inbox entry is required just to send a file. Use Inbox when a separate
notification/report handoff is intended, including unattended work whose result
needs human attention.

```bash
alice inbox push --body 'Finished — see [[research/report.md]] for evidence.'
# Publish the Markdown itself as the notification body:
alice inbox push --body-file research/report.md
```

The body is frozen at publication. `[[relative/path.ext]]` references resolve
against the publishing Workspace root and stay live; a published hash identifies
the file revision. Code examples and missing paths remain literal. Commit files
before publishing if you want Git to preserve their published content.

Read recent deliveries with:

```bash
alice inbox read --limit 5
alice inbox read --self
```

Each attachment is returned in `files[]` with a directly usable `absolutePath`,
its original `relativePath`, and the published `revision` when available. The
body preserves the Markdown and reference positions.

If `absolutePath` is null because the Workspace is unavailable or the stored
path is unsafe, do not guess it. For broader inspection of an available peer
desk, resolve its root explicitly:

```bash
alice peer path --id <workspaceId>
# Then use the Coding Agent's native Read/Search/Glob/Git capabilities.
```

There is deliberately no Workspace-level file-read command. `peer path` owns
addressing; the Coding Agent owns file operations. Reading another Workspace is
normal. Autonomous/headless work writes only its own Workspace. An attended
cross-Workspace edit requires explicit human approval and must be committed in
the peer repository so its owner can review or revert it.

For AutoQuant, a lane Report is the focused handoff and a Dossier is the
cross-lane deliverable. AutoQuant owns their contents and evidence; OpenAlice
only delivers the exact committed files and stamps their origin.

## Follow up on an existing object

Prefer the business object when one already identifies the responsible work:

```bash
alice inbox ask --id <entryId> \
  --prompt 'Why did you send this result?' --await

alice issue ask --id <issueName> --creator \
  --prompt 'Why was this Issue created?' --await
alice issue ask --id <issueName> --owner \
  --prompt 'What is the current state and next decision?' --await
alice issue ask --id <issueName> --run-id <taskId> \
  --prompt 'What happened in this execution?' --await
```

These wrappers resolve provenance without making you extract a `resumeId`.
Never choose an arbitrary old Session when an artifact lacks an exact author.

Resolution means:

- `exact`: the attributable product Session continued;
- `reconstructed`: a fresh worker was recruited only in the known Workspace;
- `unavailable`: the attributed Session or safe Workspace target cannot resume.

## Trace provenance

```bash
alice provenance show --kind inbox --inbox-entry-id <entryId>
alice provenance show --kind issue --issue-id <id>
alice provenance show --kind report --workspace-id <workspaceId> \
  --path research/report.md --revision <sha256:...>
alice provenance show --resume-id <resumeId>
alice signature show
alice session rename --resume-id <resumeId> --display-name 'AAPL desk'
```

`resumeId` is the product follow-up handle; `taskId` is one execution. Native
runtime Session ids remain backend-only. `inbox ask` identifies the sender of a
delivery, which may differ from whoever last edited its live document.

## Coordinate durable work

Issue reads span the shared board; writes belong to this Workspace:

```bash
alice issue list
alice issue list --mode detailed
alice issue show --id <name>
alice issue create --title 'Investigate the anomaly'
alice issue update --id <id> --status in_progress
alice issue comment --id <id> --text 'Evidence collected; review next.'
```

Use `issue comment` for durable discussion on this Workspace's Issue. Use
`issue ask` to interrogate a creator, fixed owner, or selected historical run.
Scheduling and the complete Issue file/assignee contract belong to the
`self-scheduling` skill.

Tracked entities are the durable cross-Workspace subject index, not tasks:

```bash
alice track search --query uranium
alice track add --name uranium-ccj --description 'Cameco — uranium miner'
```

## Upgrade managed Workspace guidance

Preview first; apply only after reviewing the plan:

```bash
alice template upgrade
alice template upgrade --mode detailed
alice template upgrade --apply
alice template upgrade --id <workspaceId>
```

Applying to a live current Workspace is blocked. A headless run may preview a
peer but cannot apply a cross-Workspace upgrade. Conflict resolution, lifecycle
guards, and managed-file boundaries are reported by the live command.


## Alice Harness injection

The Alice Project supplies this CLI and its companion Skills independently of
Chat, AutoQuant and Auto Prediction source versions. Inspect or update only this
injection layer with `alice harness upgrade` (preview) and `alice harness upgrade
--apply` (allowed while this Workspace is active; a manager may target a peer with `--id`).
Use `alice template upgrade` only for template-owned instructions and skills.

`.alice/alice-harness-version.json` records the accepted Skills file-bundle revision.
`.alice/alice-harness-config.json` controls enabled CLIs/command groups and independent Skill inclusion preferences;
disabled commands are unavailable through the gateway, including old aliases.
The live Project supplies execution, so the recorded revision does not pin an
old binary. Always discover available commands with `alice --help`.

CLI implementation updates follow the running Alice Project; they do not require
a per-Workspace file update. `alice harness upgrade` updates Skills files only.
A CLI switch does not remove its Skill, and excluding a Skill does not disable
its commands. Respect the Workspace's `skills` preferences during later updates.

When the CLI warns that companion Skills are outdated, update this Workspace
with `alice harness upgrade --apply`. Git merges non-overlapping edits. If it
reports conflicts, use `--mode detailed` to compare the previous source, local
and incoming versions. Preserve user intent while adopting current commands,
edit the conflicting files, and apply with `--keep-workspace <path>` for your
resolved copies. Use `--use-template <path>` only to deliberately replace one.
Do not re-enable excluded Skills or change unrelated files during an upgrade.
