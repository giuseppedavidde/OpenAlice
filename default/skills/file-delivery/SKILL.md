description: Send Workspace files as attachments in a Connector conversation reply using [[relative/path.ext]]. Use when the user wants a file, image, or report sent in the current chat, or when distinguishing reply attachments from an Inbox notification.

# Send files in a reply

In a Connector conversation, include a file's Workspace-relative path in double
brackets in the final reply. Create or verify the file first. For example:

```text
Here is the report.
[[reports/summary.pdf]]
The chart shows the comparison.
[[reports/chart.png]]
```

Write the actual references outside code spans or code fences. The Connector
uploads resolved files at their position in the reply, preserving the order of
text and attachments. This does not create an Inbox entry.

- Paths refer to the replying Session's Workspace. For a file from a peer
  Workspace, copy it into this Workspace before referencing it.
- Use the path and extension directly: no `file:` prefix, absolute path,
  `..`, or `|label` suffix. Missing, unreadable or unsupported references stay
  as literal text; writing a reference alone is not proof of delivery.
- The current reply limit is five unique files, each at most 1 MiB. Files retain
  their bytes. Telegram sends PNG/JPEG/WebP as photos and other supported files
  as documents. `sticker/*.png` and `sticker/*.webp` use sticker delivery; follow
  the installed sticker Skill for the available pack and usage.

Attachment-capable Connectors send files; GUI chat renders previews and opens
documents in the right panel. Images open a preview dialog when clicked.
Terminals display the text without uploading it. To discuss the syntax
without sending a file, put the reference in inline code or a code fence.

## When to use Inbox

Inbox is OpenAlice's outward-facing notification and reporting surface for the
human: alerts, findings, reports, or requests for attention that deserve their
own delivery record. Use `alice inbox push` for that purpose; the `alice` Skill's
collaboration reference describes its current commands.

A file requested in the current conversation can be sent directly in the reply.
It does not need an Inbox entry merely because it is a file. Files and Git hold
the work; Inbox communicates it to the human; peer conversations carry
Agent-to-Agent handoffs. Avoid duplicating a reply into Inbox unless a separate
notification or report handoff is intended.

## Inbox reports

For a separate notification to the human, use `alice inbox push --body 'See [[report/summary.pdf]]'` or `alice inbox push --body-file report/summary.md`. The latter publishes the Markdown itself. References remain relative to the publishing Workspace root. A normal reply does not need an Inbox entry.
