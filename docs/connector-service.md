# Connector Service

This guide owns OpenAlice external-notification connectors: process boundaries,
configuration, delivery guarantees, adapter extension, health, and packaging.
It complements [[docs/workspace-issues-and-scheduling.md]] and
[[docs/managed-workspace-runtime.md]].

## Product Contract

Connector Service projects durable OpenAlice Inbox entries into optional
external chats. It is not another agent runtime, chat input loop, or source of
truth. Telegram, Discord, and Slack are the first adapters, not hard-coded product
categories.

- Local Inbox append completes before any external request begins.
- Agent-originated pushes enter through the Workspace CLI and inherit the
  CLI's server-validated Session origin; Connector delivery has no MCP identity
  dependency.
- A failed connector never changes `inbox_push` success and never marks an
  Inbox item read.
- The service is optional in every trading mode, including lite.
- Guardian may start, stop, or restart it without restarting Alice or UTA.
- Inbox delivery remains outbound by default. Each adapter may advertise
  `inbox` and `settings` capabilities and implement those slash commands
  itself. Telegram uses an inline-button form: `/inbox` defaults to unread
  items, can switch to the full Inbox history, and `/settings` toggles Inbox
  push. Discord and Slack register the same
  commands and currently reply with a placeholder. `inboxPush: false` skips Inbox
  `deliver` for that adapter and does not affect phone-desk owner chat.
  `/link`, `/status`, and `/test` stay the generic control plane. Discord
  DMs are still not ingested.
- OpenAlice Inbox still shows the full entry. The Connector `/inbox` pull
  view is a bounded summary: title, Workspace, time, a short body prefix,
  and an attachment count. It never expands raw Workspace paths. Telegram
  keeps five items per page and hard-caps the whole page below the 4096
  plain-text limit. Each row opens a bounded detail view; entries with files
  then offer a short “view files” control.
  Callback data carries only page-local indexes or a server-validated
  Inbox entry id plus doc index, never a trusted raw path.
- On-demand file pull is not phone-desk inbound and is not an ordinary
  Inbox `deliver`. The originating Connector enqueues a bounded, TTL-limited
  artifact request (`requestId`, `connectorId`, `entryId`, `docIndex`).
  Alice’s resident action bridge drains that queue, re-reads the Inbox
  entry, resolves the Workspace, materializes the selected current file
  through the existing attachment safety path, and posts a directed
  artifact delivery back to that Connector only. Cancel does not enqueue.
  First-version pull does not change Inbox read state. Discord and Slack
  keep `/inbox` as a placeholder and reject artifact delivery as
  unimplemented.
- Connector Service never interprets chat. Alice owns the phone-desk Issue.
  Connector queues owner text and Alice drains that stack only while a live
  phone-desk Issue exists and no desk generation is running. Several stacked
  DMs become one quoted comment. Alice projects desk comments that do not
  contain the literal tag `[[no-reply]]`. Inbound Telegram comments are not
  echoed back. While a desk turn is running, Alice also ships sealed mid-turn
  `text` blocks (a tool or error followed them) so the phone chat does not
  wait for the final reply. Tool names, status, and payloads stay off Telegram.
  The trailing text still becomes today's reply comment.
- Each adapter serves one owner account/private chat. Group and channel
  broadcasting are out of scope.
- Inbox `docs` that are Markdown or static HTML reports are externalized as
  file attachments, not flattened into the message body. Telegram sends them
  only after the owner requests a file from `/inbox`; its proactive push lists
  the available files without attaching all of them. Other adapters retain
  their existing push-time attachment behavior until they implement the same
  pull controls. Alice reads the live Workspace file before crossing
  the process boundary; Connector Service never reaches into a Workspace
  itself. The Workspace artifact is never rewritten or given an agent-facing
  encoding requirement. At the externalization boundary Alice detects the
  source encoding and creates a UTF-8-with-BOM delivery copy so locale-sensitive
  mobile viewers do not guess GBK, Big5, Shift-JIS, or a Western legacy charset.
  Source and delivery byte evidence remain separate. One notification carries
  at most five files of at most 1 MiB each. Missing, oversized, unsupported,
  or path-escaping files remain visible as Inbox/report paths and never block
  the text notification. When an encoding cannot be identified safely, Alice
  sends the original bytes instead of guessing. A skipped or ambiguous
  eligible attachment is logged and leaves bridge health degraded so partial
  or unnormalized delivery is visible to operators.
- HTML report files are a presentation asset, not a Connector message format.
  Adapters send the `.html` file with a `text/html` media type and never
  inline, translate, or render those file contents into the chat body.
  OpenAlice previews static HTML in an origin-less sandbox with scripts,
  forms, navigation, and network disabled; inline CSS, SVG, and data images
  remain available for self-contained human-facing reports. Markdown remains
  the default agent-readable work product, while Inbox comments carry the
  concise summary for both the user and other agents.
- Telegram text uses `sendMessage` with `parse_mode: MarkdownV2`. Connector
  converts common GFM (`**bold**`, lists, headings, code) into MarkdownV2 and
  escapes unmatched specials so agent text does not 400. Inbox titles and
  provenance are escaped literals; Inbox bodies go through the same converter.
  If MarkdownV2 is rejected, Connector tries Bot API 10.1 `sendRichMessage`
  with the original GFM, then plain `sendMessage` (4096). Discord still uses
  its own markdown. Do not use legacy `parse_mode: Markdown`.
- Session provenance is rendered as a visible `@resumeId` signature. The
  runtime label may accompany it (`pi · @resume-…`) but must never replace it.

## Topology

```text
Workspace agent
  -> alice-workspace inbox push (CLI)
  -> InboxStore durable JSONL append
  -> non-blocking Alice bridge
  -> Connector Service on loopback
       -> adapter registry
          -> Discord Connector
          -> Telegram Connector
          -> Slack Connector
          -> future adapter

Telegram owner DM
  -> Telegram adapter (linked private chat only)
  -> Connector inbound queue
  -> Alice drain only while a live phone-desk Issue exists and no
     desk generation is running; later DMs stay stacked
  -> one Issue comment (via: telegram); several stacked DMs are
     quoted into that one comment
  -> existing comment-reply dispatch
  -> owner-chat projection unless [[no-reply]]

Telegram /inbox detail -> "view files" confirm
  -> Connector action queue (requestId, connectorId, entryId, docIndex)
  -> Alice connector action bridge drain (not the phone-desk inbound drain)
  -> Alice re-reads Inbox entry and materializes one Workspace file
  -> Connector directed artifact delivery to the requesting adapter only
```

Load-bearing paths:

- `packages/connector-protocol/` — shared schemas, definitions, public config,
  delivery and health client.
- `services/connector/src/core/` — adapter/command registry and isolated
  delivery manager.
- `services/connector/src/adapters/` — one file per platform implementation.
- `src/core/connector-config.ts` — sealed config and Guardian enable/restart
  control.
- `src/services/connector-client/` — Inbox projection, on-demand single-doc
  materialization, Alice-side health, and the resident artifact-request bridge.
- `src/workspaces/issues/telegram-desk-chat.ts` — phone-desk inbound drain
  and scheduled-fire comment stamp.
- `src/workspaces/issues/telegram-desk-project.ts` — `[[no-reply]]` filter
  and owner-chat projection.
- `src/webui/routes/connectors.ts` + `ui/src/pages/ConnectorsPage.tsx` — generic
  Settings surface.

## Configuration and Secrets

`data/config/connector-service.json` contains only `{ "enabled": boolean }` so
Guardian can decide whether to run the process without decrypting platform
credentials. `data/config/connectors.json` is an AES-256-GCM sealed envelope;
the machine key remains at `<OPENALICE_HOME>/sealing.key` outside portable
`data/`.

The Settings API never returns a bot token. It returns field definitions,
non-secret values, and `configuredSecrets` presence markers. The Settings
draft field is masked by default to keep tokens out of screenshots and
screenshares; an explicit reveal control lets the operator verify a paste.
Saving an empty secret keeps the stored value; explicitly removing its presence clears it.
A non-empty secret body is accepted only when it is a plausible token (at
least 20 non-whitespace characters); a short draft cannot replace a sealed
value. Generic Settings auto-save must omit secret fields so enable/unlink
writes cannot carry a password-manager draft. Changes touch
`data/control/restart-connector.flag`, and Guardian reconciles the process
from the same startup path.

The retired `web.port`, MCP-Ask state, and legacy Telegram connector shape
predate the 0.89.2-beta baseline and are not supported upgrade inputs.

## Adapter Extension Rule

Core dispatch must not branch on platform IDs. Adding a connector means:

1. add a `ConnectorDefinition` (fields and slash-command metadata);
2. implement `ConnectorAdapter` in its own file/package;
3. register its factory at service composition;
4. add adapter-specific tests and packaging dependencies.

The Settings renderer consumes definitions as data. The DeliveryManager test
registers a fake third adapter to prevent a future Discord/Telegram union or
`if (id === ...)` dispatch from becoming the architecture.

## Platform Setup

Discord uses a user-installed application with slash commands scoped to the
app DM context. No guild/channel is required and raw DM messages are not read.
The owner runs `/link` in the app DM, then OpenAlice stores that Discord user
ID. Telegram uses private-chat long polling; the owner starts the bot and runs
`/link`, which stores the matching user and chat IDs. Slack is a workspace-installed
app that talks only in the owner's app DM. OpenAlice is local, so Slack uses
Socket Mode (`xapp` app-level token + `xoxb` bot token) instead of a public
Request URL. Slash commands are created in the Slack app settings; Connector
listens for them over the socket and does not register them at runtime. Raw
Slack messages are not read. The owner DMs the app and runs `/link`.

Do not use Slack's hosted Deno/Functions platform for this connector. That
path expects Slack to host the app. Socket Mode plus the Web API is the
current local-app shape after the 2026 Node SDK majors (`@slack/web-api` 8,
`@slack/socket-mode` 3).

Saving valid bot credentials does not mean the connector is linked. Settings
must present the lifecycle explicitly: credentials ready, bot online and
`awaiting_link`, then linked/healthy. Starting the linking step enables the
optional Connector Service and that adapter so the external bot can actually
receive `/link`; owner/chat fields learned by the command are lifecycle output,
not ordinary operator-entered configuration. Settings Unlink clears those
learned fields and keeps the sealed token so a different private account can
run `/link`. Removing the token is a different action.

`awaiting_link` means the adapter can already receive `/link`. Telegram does
not report that until long polling has started (`onStart`); Discord waits for
the gateway to become ready. Publishing Telegram's slash-command menu is
best-effort: a failed `setMyCommands` must not block polling or Inbox delivery.
The Connector HTTP health endpoint binds before those external calls so
Guardian can probe a `starting` adapter instead of treating the whole service
as missing. A failed adapter stays registered with its `lastError` rather than
collapsing to "configured but not running."

Both adapters reject commands from any account other than the linked owner.
Use `/status` for adapter health and `/test` for an explicit delivery check.
`/test` still sends when Inbox push is off. `/inbox` and `/settings` are
capability commands: the catalog only declares them; Telegram renders
buttons, and a connector that has not implemented the form yet must still
answer the slash command.

### Setup lifecycle and UI ownership

Connector setup is a lifecycle, not a single `enabled` checkbox. Keep these
states explicit because collapsing them recreates the dead end where a token is
saved but no bot process exists to receive `/link`.

| Product state | Durable facts | Runtime fact | Primary action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Credentials needed | required secret/fields missing | adapter stopped | create the platform bot and save credentials |
| Ready to link | credentials sealed, owner absent | adapter stopped | start the bot for linking |
| Starting | adapter enabled, owner absent | service HTTP up; adapter `starting` until the platform connection is live | wait; Settings polls health without replacing form drafts |
| Awaiting link | credentials sealed, owner absent | bot online with `awaiting_link` | open the private bot chat and send `/link` |
| Linked | owner identity learned | adapter `healthy` | send tests, unlink, or receive Inbox delivery |
| Linked offline | owner identity retained | adapter/service intentionally stopped | start the connector, or unlink and relink later |
| Error | durable config retained | adapter `degraded` or service unavailable | inspect credentials and Connector logs |

The surfaces deliberately have different jobs:

- **Settings → Connectors** owns credentials, the setup sequence, enable/stop,
  unlink, linking instructions, and explicit test sends. The Telegram card also
  binds the Project's one phone-desk Issue: the Workspace picker defaults to
  the Ask Alice Chat workspace. The operator can edit What and heartbeat
  cadence, then open the ordinary Issue detail for comments. Generic
  Issue create/update cannot set `telegramConnector`.
- The phone-desk Issue is hidden from the Issue board and Tracked list. It still
  fires on `when`. Extra `telegramConnector: true` files in other Workspaces do
  not fire. Owner DMs become comments; the desk is seeded with
  `commentPrompt: '{comment}'` so those comments are the reply Input Prompt
  as-is. Scheduled-fire `assistantText` is stamped as a comment. Connector
  projects those comments unless they contain the literal tag `[[no-reply]]`
  or arrived from Telegram. Pending comment replies also carry compact turn
  progress. The phone desk ships sealed mid-turn `text` blocks (the last
  consecutive text before a tool or error) and skips tool/error blocks. A
  text already sent this way is not sent again as the final comment.
- **Beta → Connectors** is a read-only operations view: service health, adapter
  status, linked owner, and last delivery evidence.
- **Dev Panel** may expose logs and replay tooling, but it is not a product
  configuration surface.

The Connector Service switch is a global kill switch. Starting an adapter from
the setup flow may enable the service and adapter together; stopping the global
service never deletes sealed credentials or the learned owner. Health polling
during linking updates runtime health only. It must not replace the current
Settings draft, reveal secrets, or create an auto-save/restart loop.

## Health Contract and Tests

UTA and Connector Service are both optional external services. Alice probes
them through the same health contract and reports one of three phases:

- `disabled`: intentionally switched off; no network request is made.
- `healthy`: the endpoint returned 2xx and its service-specific body passed
  schema validation.
- `degraded`: enabled but not configured, unreachable, timed out, returned a
  non-2xx response, or returned an invalid body.

Each probe also records a stable reason code, check timestamp, and latency. A
failed optional-service probe must never change Alice or Inbox availability.
An adapter in `starting` or `awaiting_link` is online and intentionally
incomplete, so it does not degrade the service; external notification delivery
becomes healthy only after the owner runs `/link`.
The contract matrix lives in `src/services/optional-carrier/health.spec.ts`;
`integrations.spec.ts` applies it to the real UTA and Connector response shapes.
Guardian/process smoke tests remain responsible for proving that an enabled
service actually starts and reaches its health endpoint.

## Two-Layer External Acceptance

External SDKs cannot be closed-loop tested by treating a successful HTTP call
as proof that a human-visible DM arrived. Connector acceptance therefore has
two explicit layers.

### Layer 1: recorded contract replay

Connector Service writes a bounded, private JSONL journal to
`data/logs/connector-io.jsonl` (one rotated generation at `.1`). It records:

- normalized Inbox notification text at service ingress;
- delivery attachment evidence (`filename`, media type, byte size, and
  SHA-256), plus source size, digest, and detected encoding when available,
  without repeating base64 file bodies into every ingress/adapter journal event;
- per-adapter delivery attempt, success, or failure tied to one correlation ID;
- inbound slash-command name and pseudonymized user/chat IDs;
- command replies and command failures.

Bot tokens are never journaled. Platform user and chat IDs are stable SHA-256
pseudonyms so authorization/equality cases remain replayable without retaining
raw external identifiers. Notification text is retained because it is the
payload under test; the journal is mode `0600`, bounded to 5 MiB, and remains
local to the OpenAlice data home. Adapter tests own byte-level attachment
decoding/upload contracts; replay owns the durable text and attachment-evidence
contract without growing the journal into a report archive.

`services/connector/test-fixtures/io-smoke.jsonl` is a safe fixture. The replay
harness consumes only `notification.received` events and runs them through a
fake adapter; recorded success/failure events are evidence and are never
mistaken for new inputs. The real process smoke also waits for its accepted
notification to appear in the journal. Run `pnpm test:connector-replay` for the
offline fixture lane and `pnpm test:connector-service` after building the
service for the real-process/journal lane.

### Layer 2: opt-in web DM confirmation

When the operator explicitly permits external-account testing and a signed-in
browser profile is available:

1. use **Send test** in Connector Settings and copy its unique
   `connector-probe-xxxxxxxx` ID;
2. open the linked owner's Discord Web or Telegram Web private bot chat;
3. confirm the exact probe ID appears once in the DM;
4. send `/status` and confirm a reply, then verify matching
   `command.received` and `command.replied` journal events;
5. record the lane as passed, failed, or skipped with a reason.

Browser confirmation is never run silently: it touches an external account and
creates messages. Without permission, credentials, and a signed-in owner
session, this layer must be reported as **skipped**, not passed. Platform web UI
automation is an acceptance aid, not a CI dependency.

## Acceptance

Changes to this subsystem require:

- protocol/service typecheck and adapter registry tests;
- recorded I/O fixture replay and journal privacy/rotation tests;
- an isolated Connector Service process health + accepted-delivery smoke;
- proof that Inbox append succeeds when Connector Service is absent;
- Settings browser verification without exposing token values;
- dev Guardian enable/restart/disable recovery under an isolated
  `OPENALICE_HOME`;
- Docker build/runtime smoke and packaged Electron resource assertion.

Real Telegram/Discord delivery needs user-owned platform credentials and is a
manual acceptance lane; credential-free CI must not pretend that a live
third-party message was delivered.
