# Web conversation surface

The Web surface presents an existing Workspace Session in the browser through
its runtime's own structured protocol instead of a PTY. It is a presentation of
the same durable Session, not another runtime: the runtime still owns the
transcript, credentials, tools, and approvals; Alice keeps one long-lived child
process per Session record and projects that process's protocol into one
neutral live snapshot.

Read this guide before changing `src/workspaces/web-session-host.ts`,
`src/workspaces/web-session/`, `composeWebCommand`, the `/api/workspaces/:id/sessions/:sid/web/*`
routes, or the browser modules `useWebConversation`, `web-presentation.ts`,
`WebSessionView`, and `ConversationRequestCard`. Rendering rules live in
[[docs/ui-interaction-and-motion.md]]; Manager-specific launch rules live in
[[docs/workspace-manager.md]].

## Ownership

| Layer | Owner | Must not |
|---|---|---|
| Adapter (`src/workspaces/adapters/<agent>.ts`) | Declare `capabilities.web = { wire, permissionPrompts, freshSession }` and compose the structured-mode argv in `composeWebCommand` | Parse protocol output or hold session state |
| Transport (`src/workspaces/web-session/<wire>-transport.ts`) | Speak exactly one wire over the child's stdio, drive `WebSessionState`, surface requests, learn the native session id | Spawn processes, touch the registry, or know which adapter launched it |
| Host (`src/workspaces/web-session-host.ts`) | Spawn/supervise the process, own the snapshot revision, dispatch prompt/abort/respond to the transport, tail stderr | Branch on agent ids or wire names |
| Service/routes | Bind the Session record and `resumeId`, enforce one live process per Session, expose the snapshot | Reach into transport internals |
| Browser | Poll the snapshot, group the neutral messages into turns, answer requests with an option id | Import runtime APIs or branch on the wire beyond copy |

`agy` and `shell` have no structured protocol and stay TUI-only. Do not add a
Web capability to a runtime whose structured mode cannot round-trip tool
approval or cannot reopen an exact recorded conversation.

## Wires

| Wire | Runtimes | Process | Permission prompts | Fresh session |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pi-rpc` | `pi`, `omp` | `--mode rpc` JSONL; Pi additionally `--approve`, omp `--auto-approve` | none in RPC mode; launch-time approval | yes (RPC allocates the id) |
| `acp` | `cursor`, `grok`, `opencode` | Agent Client Protocol JSON-RPC over stdio (`cursor-agent acp`, `grok agent --no-leader stdio`, `opencode acp`) | `session/request_permission` with the agent's own options | `session/new`; resume via `session/load` when advertised |
| `claude-stream-json` | `claude` | `-p --input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json --include-partial-messages --permission-prompt-tool stdio` | `control_request` `can_use_tool`; answered with allow/deny | `--session-id <uuid>` chosen by the adapter |
| `codex-app-server` | `codex` | `codex app-server --listen stdio://` with MCP registration, `approvalPolicy: on-request`, `sandbox: workspace-write` | `item/commandExecution/requestApproval`, `item/fileChange/requestApproval` (answered with a `decision` enum), `item/permissions/requestApproval` (answered with the granted `permissions` profile + `scope`), `item/tool/requestUserInput` | `thread/start`; resume via `thread/resume` |

If ACP does not advertise `loadSession`, opening an existing Session fails with
terminal guidance and preserves its native ID. Never replace its transcript
with `session/new`; only a separate fresh Session may allocate a new ID.

The Web surface never resumes "last": it reopens the exact recorded native id
or starts a fresh conversation the transport reports back, so the Session's
`resumeId` binds to one native transcript exactly as PTY discovery does.

Codex wire enums (`AskForApproval`, `SandboxMode`) are kebab-case and its
server-request response shapes differ per method; verify against
`codex app-server generate-json-schema --out <dir>` from the installed binary
before changing the transport rather than inferring from TypeScript-style
names.

Every transport must leave the snapshot in `idle` (or `failed` when the process
is gone) with `error` set when a prompt is rejected before the turn starts —
for example missing credentials. A snapshot stuck in `working` with no turn in
flight is a transport bug, not a runtime condition.

## Neutral model

`src/workspaces/web-session/model.ts` is the contract the browser mirrors in
`ui/src/components/workspace/api.ts`:

- `WebConversationMessage` borrows Pi's minimal roles — `user`, `assistant`
  (text / thinking / toolCall / data parts), `toolResult`, plus `notice` for
  system remarks and `unknown` for records a transport could not classify.
  Keep unknown records; they are the audit trail for protocol drift.
- `WebPermissionRequest` carries the runtime's own option list. Transports
  translate protocol enums into `{ id, label, tone }`; the browser answers
  with the same `id`. Never synthesize options a runtime did not offer.
- `WebSessionPhase` adds `awaiting-input` to the WebPi phases: the turn is
  still in flight and blocked on the user. Prompting during it is rejected;
  aborting drops the pending requests.
- `streamingMessage` is the cumulative in-flight assistant message and is
  replaced, never appended; transports move it into `messages` when the turn
  ends.

The snapshot is ephemeral. Do not persist it, do not migrate it, and do not
read it back as a transcript.

## Persisted surface value

`SessionRecord.surface` keeps the shipped value `webpi` (migration 0040) for
every runtime that opens in the Web surface. Renaming it would require a
migration for no behavioral gain; free-floating identifiers (routes, host,
components, labels) use "Web". User-facing copy says "Web", never "WebPi".

## Routes

- `POST /web/open` — checks `capabilities.web`, refuses a Session with a
  running headless turn, disposes a PTY on the same record, starts the host.
- `GET /web?revision=` — snapshot or `{ unchanged: true }`.
- `POST /web/prompt`, `POST /web/abort` — turn control.
- `POST /web/respond { requestId, optionId, text? }` — answers one request; the
  transport validates the option id and fails with `web_respond_failed`. For a
  question with `allowText`, send `optionId: ""` and nonblank `text` to answer
  freely. Permission requests reject text answers. Secret questions use a masked
  field. Cancelling a turn clears the entire pending question sequence.

Switching a running Web Session to the TUI stops the Web process first; the
reverse disposes the PTY. Exactly one process may own a Session record.

## Browser

`agentSupportsWeb(agents, agent)` is the only gate for launch affordances.
Runtime identity affects copy (placeholder, stop label, wire tooltip) and
nothing else. The request card is pinned above the composer; see
[[docs/ui-interaction-and-motion.md]] for the interaction rules. Demo mode
mirrors the capability table in `ui/src/demo/fixtures/web-session.ts` and
scripts a permission turn for prompting runtimes; update it with any contract
change.

## Verification

- `npx tsc --noEmit`, `pnpm test`, `cd ui && npx tsc -b`.
- `src/workspaces/web-session-host.spec.ts` drives a fake child over stdio for
  every wire; extend it when a transport learns a new message.
- `src/workspaces/adapters/web-command.spec.ts` pins each runtime's argv.
- `pnpm -F open-alice-ui dev:demo`: open a Claude/Codex/ACP quick chat, answer
  the request card, stop mid-turn, and confirm the notice.
- Live acceptance needs installed runtimes and is not part of routine CI: for
  each runtime, open one Session in Web, send a prompt that needs a tool,
  answer the card, stop mid-turn, then reopen the same Session in the TUI and
  confirm the native transcript is shared. State the gap when this was not run.

Grok agent flags belong after the `agent` subcommand; the pager TUI rejects
top-level `--no-leader` when launching ACP. Verify argv with the installed CLI,
not just a fake process. Startup errors retain the child exit diagnostic rather
than replacing it with transport-disposal errors. Failed opens are rolled back
by their route, so exit callbacks must not race that registry write. During a
live ACP turn, user-message echoes are ignored because prompt() already
appended the message; history replay still consumes user-message chunks.

### Native protocol differences

- OMP emits `agent_end` without Pi's later `agent_settled`; both must settle the
  turn and clear the streaming copy. A retrying agent_end must remain busy.
- Pi/OMP can accept a prompt and later emit an assistant with `stopReason:
  error` and `errorMessage`. Surface that error, including on history load;
  an empty assistant body is not a successful reply.
- Claude stream-json does not replay old messages on --resume. The transport
  loads the exact native session file under CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR (or the native
  home default), follows the latest main parent chain, and excludes abandoned
  branches and sidechains. It does not create another transcript store.
- OpenCode ACP does not accept --model. Session projection sets its model in
  process-local OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT and leaves Web argv free of that flag.
  Native-session config selectors can confirm the effective model. ACP also
  exposes [session configuration options](https://agentclientprotocol.com/announcements/session-config-options-stabilized).

A default handshake is insufficient acceptance for an adapter: also exercise
an explicit model, a completed turn, errors, and exact-session restoration with
the installed CLI. Keep login/provider/version failures distinct from parser
or lifecycle defects, and never claim every runtime passed from one shared
wire's fake-process fixture.
