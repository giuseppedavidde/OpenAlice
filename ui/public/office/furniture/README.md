# Office generated furniture

These versioned PNG files are the generated environment pack for the Office
overworld. Alice uses the purpose-built `alice-overworld-v1.png` four-direction
sheet, while runtime coworkers use their own portrait and seated families.

Art direction:

- polished 16-bit-era pixel art;
- consistent top-down three-quarter projection;
- 16 px base-tile proportions with 1x1 to 4x3-tile props;
- upper-left lighting;
- warm walnut, parchment cream, muted olive, charcoal outlines, and teal screens;
- genuine transparent alpha and tight object shadows;
- no text, logos, characters, UI panels, or baked backgrounds.

The visual style master is stored at
`docs/assets/office/style-master-v1.png`; it is a generation reference, not a
runtime asset. Generate each new prop as a standalone transparent image using
that master as the style reference, verify its alpha channel, and add it to
`ui/src/office/furniture.ts` before use.

Environment textures may be opaque when they intentionally fill the entire
canvas. Repeating floor textures must stay orthographic and quiet; wall modules
must tile horizontally; Workspace rugs define a functional neighborhood but
must not recreate card or room boundaries.

Current runtime assets:

- `workstation-v2.png`
- `vacant-workstation-v2.png` — powered-down empty-chair variant for unoccupied Session slots
- `filing-cabinet-v2.png`
- `empty-cabinet-v1.png` — open, visibly empty drawer vignette for a Workspace with no filed records
- `terminal-kiosk-v2.png`
- `plant-v2.png`
- `wall-window-v2.png`
- `wall-window-night-v2.png` — geometry-matched after-hours window variant
- `wall-utility-v1.png` — archive shelving and network-control module centered behind Operations
- `wall-utility-night-v1.png` — geometry-matched after-hours utility module
- `building-foundation-v1.png` — seamless dark structural material outside the playable floor
- `floor-edge-bottom-v1.png` and `floor-edge-side-v1.png` — generated low structural curb tiles that make the
  left, right, and bottom walkable boundary visible; the left edge mirrors the side asset while preserving one
  authored collision footprint
- `floor-tile-v2.png`
- `workspace-rug-v2.png`
- `coffee-station-v2.png` — Chat neighborhood social prop

`wall-window-night-v2.png` was produced as a geometry-locked lighting edit of
the daytime window module, followed by a background-extraction pass to restore
real alpha. `OfficeBuilding` selects the day or night module from the effective
theme preference, including system-resolved Auto mode.

`wall-utility-v1.png` replaces one repeated window at the Operations axis with built-in archive shelves and a
network console. It preserves the 204x102 wall-module canvas, so the fixture enriches the perimeter without adding
floor collision or a new card-shaped region. Its Night sibling keeps the same silhouette and uses restrained cyan
machine light instead of dimming the whole Office scene.
- `server-rack-v2.png` — AutoQuant neighborhood operations prop
- `prediction-console-v1.png` — Auto Prediction probability-and-evidence console
- `personnel-board-v2.png` — interactive roster prop for groups with more than four Sessions
- `operations-board-v2.png` — floor landmark that opens the live occupancy log and replay
- `workspace-sign-v2.png` — blank physical placard behind live Workspace, Harness, and agent text
- `spawn-inlay-v1.png` — flat four-direction floor mosaic beneath Alice's neutral reset point; its thin brass line,
  muted teal field, and shadowless silhouette read as walkable inlay rather than a raised interactive prop
- `route-footsteps-v1.png` — generated 12px low-contrast floor breadcrumbs for click-to-interact paths
- `route-destination-v1.png` — generated 20px quiet destination diamond for click-to-interact routes
- `collision-impact-v1.png` — generated four-frame blocked-movement sparkle at native 24px cells
- `mail-service-v1.png` — water cooler and mail-sorting landmark for the open service edge
- `archive-service-v1.png` — copier and archive-trolley landmark for the open service edge
- `service-placard-v1.png` — blank generated floor nameplate shared by the Inbox and News service machines;
  localized runtime text identifies each service without baking language into the art

The v2 environment pack converts the original generated masters into their actual runtime canvases with
nearest-neighbor sampling, hard alpha, and compact 48- or 64-color palettes. Fifteen formerly 1K-scale sources
totaling 12.49 MiB become a 106.5 KiB native pack while preserving their existing contain/fill composition.

`operations-board-v2.png` was generated from the locked style master as a freestanding, width-dominant
mission console with an abstract teal status display and no baked words. The built-in image generator
rendered it on a flat magenta key; the repository copy uses locally extracted transparent alpha.

`workspace-sign-v2.png` was generated from the same style master as a wide walnut-and-teal physical
placard with no baked text. Runtime HTML supplies the localized Harness label, Workspace title, and
agent count over its quiet center panel, preserving dynamic data and accessible text without reverting
to a dashboard card.

`vacant-workstation-v2.png` preserves the workstation footprint while removing the cyan screen and tower
glow. It was generated on a flat magenta key, processed with the ImageGen chroma-key helper, and packaged
with real alpha. Empty slots remain disabled scenery, but no longer disappear into the rug as if their
assets failed to load.

`route-footsteps-v1.png` is a paired, offset footprint generated with muted teal-gray and cream clusters, then
hard-alpha packaged on a native 12px canvas. Runtime rotation supplies four directions. The static markers sit on
Alice's visual foot line and are thinned to every other 24px route cell, so they guide without flashing over the map.

`route-destination-v1.png` is a symmetric hollow diamond generated in the same restrained palette and hard-alpha
packaged on a native 20px canvas. It replaces the bouncing cream-gold cursor in both the world and route-status strip;
the active object still retains its nameplate, target identity, accessible name, and unchanged hit area.

`collision-impact-v1.png` is a 96x24 transparent atlas with contact, star, arc, and fragment frames. Runtime
rotation supplies four collision directions. Reduced-motion mode holds the bright second frame for the same short
lifetime instead of animating the sheet; the effect is decorative and does not compete with interaction prompts.

`mail-service-v1.png` and `archive-service-v1.png` were generated together from the locked style master, extracted
from a chroma-key sheet, baseline-aligned, nearest-neighbor reduced to 120x104, and quantized against one 64-color
palette. One-row maps place them along the open lower service edge. Multi-row maps place the pair inside the first
unused cell of a partial final row, turning a structural grid gap into a service bay without crowding complete floors.

`service-placard-v1.png` is a single low-profile walnut, brass, and dark-teal floor nameplate generated from the
locked style master, then nearest-neighbor reduced to a transparent 80x40 runtime canvas. The inset stays blank so
localized HTML can label Inbox and News while both landmarks retain one shared environmental asset.

`empty-cabinet-v1.png` was generated from the locked style master and the shipped cabinet identity as a single
cream two-drawer cabinet with its upper drawer pulled open and visibly empty. The transparent master was trimmed,
hard-matted, and nearest-neighbor packaged on a native 96x88 canvas for the compact cabinet empty state; it contains
no paper, folders, labels, characters, or UI frame.

`prediction-console-v1.png` gives the Prediction neighborhood its own physical identity instead of reusing the
generic terminal kiosk. Its abstract probability bars, branching outcome display, paired result lights, and paper
evidence tray contain no baked text. The built-in image generator followed the locked style master; the repository
copy removes the generated checkerboard, hard-mats the alpha, and packages the prop on a native 72x88 canvas.

`building-foundation-v1.png` replaces the exposed green checkerboard around maps narrower than the available
stage. It is an opaque, seamless 192px structural-panel texture generated from the locked style master and kept
substantially darker than the walkable Office floor. The floor retains a hard double outline, so the material reads
as non-playable building depth rather than another room or a path Alice can enter.
